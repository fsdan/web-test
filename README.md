Scott, I get emails from a raccoon. So, nothing sounds crazy anymore. Even if there's a small chance that we can undo this, I mean, we owe it to everyone who is not in this room, to try._

_I wanna tell you a story
about the time there were three ogres, right? And then one of ‘em hit me so hard I almost died. You were sitting up in some sort of weird laser just shooting flasks willy-nilly, Travis was ripping the arms off a robot, and I got punched so hard I almost died! I’m not gonna go toe-to-toe with a crab while you’re armed with a terrible Scottish accent, and Travis doesn’t even have his shield! I’m out!”
